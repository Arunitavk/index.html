        <h2>Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But when you’re in the flow, it’s incredibly rewarding.</h2>
        <p>We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people we make it for.</p>

        <h2>We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.</h2>
        <p>Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music culture.</p>
